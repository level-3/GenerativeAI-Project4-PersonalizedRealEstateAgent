    "# Real Estate Chatbot Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This code implements a conversational AI real estate assistant called \"HomeMatch\" that helps users find properties based on their preferences. The system uses LangChain, OpenAI's GPT models, and Gradio to create an interactive chat interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Models\n",
    "- `Listing`: Base model for property listings stored in a database\n",
    "- `Property`: Detailed property information model including:\n",
    "  - Basic details (location, price, size, bedrooms, bathrooms)\n",
    "  - Descriptions (property and suburb descriptions)\n",
    "  - Marketing elements (highlights, tag line, call to action)\n",
    "- `BuyerPreferences`: Model for storing user preferences including:\n",
    "  - Location (limited to specific towns)\n",
    "  - Budget and size requirements\n",
    "  - Room requirements (bedrooms/bathrooms)\n",
    "  - Desired features and lifestyle preferences\n",
    "- `AgentState`: Tracks conversation state including:\n",
    "  - Message history\n",
    "  - Extracted preferences\n",
    "  - Matched properties\n",
    "  - Formatted descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Core Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extract Preferences Tool\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@tool\n",
    "def extract_preferences(state: AgentState) -> Optional[BuyerPreferences]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Analyzes conversation history to extract structured buyer preferences\n",
    "- Uses GPT model with a template to parse user requirements\n",
    "- Returns formatted BuyerPreferences object\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Match Properties Tool\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@tool\n",
    "def match_properties(buyer_preferences: BuyerPreferences) -> str\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Takes structured preferences and finds matching properties\n",
    "- Uses embeddings for semantic search of property database\n",
    "- Generates detailed, formatted property descriptions\n",
    "- Returns formatted string with property matches\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Conversation Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "The system uses a StateGraph workflow with three main nodes:\n",
    "1. `agent`: Processes user input and determines next actions\n",
    "2. `tools`: Executes tools (preference extraction or property matching)\n",
    "3. `respond`: Generates final responses to the user\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow control:\n",
    "- Entry point is the \"agent\" node\n",
    "- Uses `should_continue()` to determine whether to:\n",
    "  - Continue to tools\n",
    "  - Generate a response\n",
    "- Tools feed back to agent for further processing\n",
    "- Responses end the current conversation cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Templates and Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "The system uses several prompt templates:\n",
    "- Main system template: Defines the assistant's personality and behavior\n",
    "- Extract preferences template: Guidelines for parsing user preferences\n",
    "- Property description template: Format for property listings\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. User Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses Gradio's ChatInterface for:\n",
    "- Real-time chat interaction\n",
    "- Message history management\n",
    "- Streaming responses\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Natural Language Understanding\n",
    "   - Extracts structured preferences from casual conversation\n",
    "   - Maintains context across multiple messages\n",
    "   - Handles various ways users might express preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Property Matching\n",
    "   - Semantic search using embeddings\n",
    "   - Considers multiple criteria simultaneously\n",
    "   - Ranks and returns best matches\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Response Generation\n",
    "   - Generates engaging, emoji-enhanced property descriptions\n",
    "   - Includes marketing elements (tag lines, calls to action)\n",
